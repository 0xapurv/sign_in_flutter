### **Checkout my Medium article ["Flutter: Implementing Google Sign In"](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-implementing-google-sign-in-71888bca24ed).**

In this app, I have implemented **Google Sign In** using **Firebase** for both Android and iOS, fixing all the issues with the latest Flutter updates. To understand how to fix all the **Firebase** issues in **Flutter** make sure you check out my **Medium aticle**.

## Flutter 1.7 updates

With the introduction of Flutter 1.7, the most frustrating thing fixing **AndriodX incompatibilities** has been taken care of. Now, you can just create a new project using the `--androidx` flag to ensure the generated project targets the new support library.

## Firebase changes

Now, you need to fill the **OAuth consent form** in order to use **Firebase** in your app, otherwise your app will just crash. So, make sure you checkout my **Medium article**.
